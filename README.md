# SPACE! The dumbest frontier!

A basic space game. It's a demo of [Chingu](https://github.com/ippa/chingu),
made during a Madison Ruby user group hack night.

To play:

    # Ruby 1.9+
    ruby play.rb

Controls:

    Up/down/left/right: they do what you think
    Escape: quit

Rules:

* Crash into enemy Sprites (hurr hurr) to destroy them
* Revel in the power of game development in 2012!

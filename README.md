# SPACE! The dumbest frontier!

A basic space game. It's a demo of [Chingu](https://github.com/ippa/chingu),
made during a Madison Ruby user group hack night.

## Start the game

    # Ruby 1.9+
    ruby play.rb

## Controls:

Up/down/left/righ do what you think. You can hold the keys.

`Escape` to quit.

## Rules:

* Crash into enemy Sprites (hurr hurr) to destroy them
* Revel in the power of game development in 2012!
